# Flight-Reservation-System-
A flight reservation system that works for several flights and aircrafts
This was a school assignment that allowed us to use all the lessons we learned throughout the semester and put them together
in a final project. The project includes loops, branching, exceptions, heavy object oriented programming (inheritance, polymoprhism, etc),
sets, maps, and comparator interfaces.
